Ron's Final Project: Serverless CI/CD Pipeline with AWS Step Functions & Terraform





Welcome to my final project! In this project, I demonstrate how to create a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for serverless applications using AWS services such as Step Functions, Lambda, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline, and Terraform. This project will guide you through automating deployments and orchestrating workflows in AWS.






Overview

This project aims to:

Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate serverless application deployments.
Use AWS Step Functions to visualize and manage different stages of the deployment.
Implement infrastructure as code with Terraform to provision necessary AWS resources.
Introduce a rollback mechanism that ensures stability in production environments.
By the end of this project, you will learn how to:



Create a Step Functions state machine to orchestrate tasks like validation, testing, deployment, and rollback.
Deploy serverless applications automatically using CodeDeploy.
Use Lambda functions for various pipeline stages, such as validation, testing, and rollback.
Automate infrastructure management using Terraform.
How the CI/CD Pipeline Works




The pipeline is divided into several stages. Each stage automates a part of the deployment process:

Code Commit: The pipeline starts when code is committed to a version control system (e.g., GitHub or GitLab).
CodePipeline: AWS CodePipeline listens for code commits and triggers the pipeline.
Lambda - Validate Code: A Lambda function validates the code. If it fails, the pipeline stops and flags the issue.
CodeDeploy - Deploy to Staging: The application is deployed to a staging environment for testing.
Automated Tests: Tests are run to verify the application’s functionality. If successful, it proceeds; otherwise, it triggers a rollback.
Step Functions - Conditional Logic: AWS Step Functions manage the flow of tasks, deciding whether to proceed to production or trigger a rollback.
Lambda - Rollback: If any failure occurs (e.g., test failure), a Lambda function rolls back the deployment to the previous stable state.
CodeDeploy - Deploy to Production: After staging tests pass, the app is deployed to production.
Success: The pipeline finishes, indicating a successful deployment.

Key Project Files and Their Roles

1. Terraform Infrastructure (main.tf)
This file provisions all the necessary AWS resources for your CI/CD pipeline. It uses Terraform to create and configure:



S3 Buckets: For storing build artifacts and deployment packages.
IAM Roles: For security and granting access to AWS services like Lambda, CodePipeline, and CodeDeploy.
CodeDeploy & CodePipeline: To handle the deployment of the application and automate the flow.
This file sets up the infrastructure you need to support the serverless application and its deployment pipeline.

Example Section in main.tf:

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "artifact_bucket" {
  bucket = "serverless-artifact-bucket"
}


2. Lambda Functions (lambda.tf)
This file defines the AWS Lambda functions that are used throughout the pipeline. These functions perform specific tasks at various stages of the pipeline, including:

Code Validation: Verifying the integrity of the code before deployment.
Automated Testing: Running tests to ensure the application works as expected.
Rollback: Reverting to a stable version of the application if something goes wrong.
Each Lambda function has an associated IAM role that grants it permissions to interact with the necessary AWS services.

Example Lambda Function:

resource "aws_lambda_function" "validate_code" {
  function_name = "validate_code"
  role          = aws_iam_role.lambda_exec_role.arn
  handler       = "index.handler"
  runtime       = "nodejs18.x"
  filename      = "validate_code.zip"
}



3. Step Functions (step-functions.tf)
This file configures AWS Step Functions to manage the orchestration of tasks. Step Functions act as the "brain" of the pipeline, directing the flow between the various stages (like Lambda function executions, deployments, and tests).

Key tasks defined here:

Validate Code: Invokes the validate_code Lambda function.
Run Tests: Executes automated tests through the run_tests Lambda.
Deploy to Staging/Production: Uses CodeDeploy for deployments.
Conditional Logic: Decides whether to move forward with production or initiate a rollback.
Example State Machine:

{
  "StartAt": "ValidateCode",
  "States": {
    "ValidateCode": {
      "Type": "Task",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:123456789012:function:validate_code",
      "Next": "RunTests"
    },
    "RunTests": {
      "Type": "Task",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-2:123456789012:function:run_tests",
      "Next": "DeployStaging"
    }
  }
}


How Each File Connects Together
main.tf provisions the infrastructure and sets up the AWS resources required for the pipeline.
lambda.tf defines the Lambda functions that will be triggered at different stages of the pipeline.
step-functions.tf organizes and manages the flow of the pipeline by orchestrating Lambda functions and deployments.
How to Get Started

Follow these steps to set up and run this project:

Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have:

Terraform installed on your local machine.
An AWS account and configured AWS CLI to authenticate with your AWS resources.
Lambda function ZIP files (validate_code.zip, run_tests.zip, staging.zip, production.zip) ready to be uploaded.
Steps to Deploy the Pipeline
Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/serverless-cicd-pipeline.git
Install Terraform
If you haven’t already, install Terraform by following the Terraform installation guide.
Configure AWS Credentials
Ensure that your AWS credentials are configured:
aws configure
Deploy Infrastructure Using Terraform
Navigate to the directory containing your Terraform files and run the following commands:
terraform init    # Initialize the Terraform configuration
terraform plan    # Review the resources that will be created
terraform apply   # Apply the configuration to provision AWS resources
Monitor the Pipeline
Once your infrastructure is deployed, monitor the pipeline:
CodePipeline: Check the status of the pipeline.
Step Functions: Visualize the state machine execution.
Lambda Logs: Look at the Lambda logs for any errors or issues.
Rollback Mechanism

This pipeline includes an automatic rollback feature:

If tests fail or an error occurs during deployment, Step Functions will trigger a rollback.
A Lambda function restores the previous stable version, ensuring your production environment stays healthy.
